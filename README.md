# Login & Form Validation üìù

A simple Login & Form Validation project that validates user input in a sign-up form. It provides visual feedback to users by highlighting input fields when selected and changing the outline color based on the validity of the input.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a user-friendly sign-up form with interactive validation features. When users interact with the form, such as clicking on input fields or submitting the form, visual cues indicate whether the input is valid or requires correction. This enhances the user experience and helps prevent submission of incorrect or incomplete data.

## Features

- Interactive form validation: Provides visual feedback to users when interacting with input fields.
- Dynamic class manipulation: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically add or remove CSS classes to alter the appearance of input fields based on validation status.
- DOM manipulation: Manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to update HTML elements and apply visual changes.
- JavaScript functions: Implements JavaScript functions to handle form validation logic and event listeners for user interactions.
- Form validation techniques: Demonstrates various form validation techniques, including checking for empty fields and validating email format.
